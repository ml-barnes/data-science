    "- The first method `__init__` is a special method, which is called a class constructor. It is the initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is `self`. When you call a method of a class instance, Python adds the `self` argument to the list for you. `self` represents the instance object automatically which is passed to the class instance's method when called, to identify the instance that called it. `self` is used to access other attributes or methods of the object from inside the method as for instance `self.name`. The `self` in Python is equivalent to the `self` pointer in C++ and the `this` reference in Java and C#."
